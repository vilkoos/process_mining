# process_mining

This report documents the use of [ProM Lite](http://www.promtools.org/doku.php?id=promlite11) to explore and analyse process behaviour and to find the process structure.
The analysis is a mini project that was suggested by the authors of the TUe/FutureLearn MOOC [Introduction to Process Mining with ProM](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/process-mining). 

The report can be found in the file **process_analysis.md**
